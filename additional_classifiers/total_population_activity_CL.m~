classdef total_population_activity_CL

% total_population_activity_CL is a classifier object (CL) 
%  that learns a scalar value (template) that is the sum of the population activity from all 
%  neurons from the training data (a separate scalar value is learned for each class).  
%  When the classifier is tested, the euclidean distance is calculated between a test point's total 
%  population activity and the population activity from each class template scalar value, 
%  and the class with the smallest euclidean distance value is selected as the label
%  (and the decision values are -1 times the euclidean distance).  
%
%
% Like all CL objects, there are two main methods, which are:
%
%  1.  cl = train(cl, XTr, YTr) 
%         This method takes the training data (XTr, YTr) and learns the mean population activity 
%           scalar (i.e., a template) for each class.
% 
%  2.  [predicted_labels decision_values] = test(cl, XTe)
%         This method takes the test data and calculates the euclidean distance
%           value between each test point total population activity and each learned class scalar template.  
%           The predicted label for a test point is the class that had the smallest euclidean distance
%           value with the test point, and the decision values are -1 times the distance values.
%
%
%  Notes:  
%
%    1.  If there is a tie among the decision values  (i.e., if the distance
%          value is the same for 2 different classes), then one of tied the classes
%          is chosen randomly as the predicted label.
%  
%
%   XTr and XTe are in the form [num_features x num_examples]
%   YTr is in the form [num_examples x 1]
